/r/hapso.py


Bill Garate (@billwritescode), Michael Garate (@mpgarate), and Katie Simon (@katiewsimon) built /r/hapso.py at the Automated Music Hackathon at Spotify in February 2015.

This program reads in JSON data from specified subreddits on reddit.com (/r/Music in the example) and transforms data points for use in a SuperCollider script that outputs sounds. The program uses data to specify instrument, pitch, duration, and volume.
